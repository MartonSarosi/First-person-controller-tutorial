# Teleportation tutorial

This tutorial will take you through making a teleporter in Unity.

## Setting up the scene.

For this tutorial I will assume you have your own character controller and an environment (at the very least a plane) where you can walk around.
First we will add a cube to our scene. You can resize this cube or remove the mesh renderer depending on your needs. I will resize it to make it look like a platform and make it purple.

We also have to make sure that the collider of this object is set to Is Trigger.
